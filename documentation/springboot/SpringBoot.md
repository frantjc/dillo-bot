# [SpringBoot](https://spring.io/)

This project was bootstrapped using [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/) and is uses SpringBoot's MVC structure.

The `@Command` annotation is also modeled after SpringBoot's `@RequestMapping` annotation.

Pretty much everything in the project that isn't documented in [`documentation/`](../../documentation) falls under SpringBoot. It's pretty awesome.
