# [FlyWay](https://flywaydb.org/)

FlyWay is the tool you would use to add a new table, column or row to DilloBot's database. For example, if you wanted DilloBot to know everyone's birthday, you would have FlyWay create a birthday table and add a row for each birthday that you wanted DilloBot to know.

The code for FlyWay exists exclusively in [`src/main/resources/db/migrations/`](../../src/main/resources/db/migrations) and [`src/main/resources/application.yml`](../../src/main/resources/application.yml).
