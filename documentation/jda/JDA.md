# [JDA (Java Discord API)](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA)

Definitely the most fringe tool used in the project, but also arguably the most important as JDA interacts with Discord.  A lot of the code that interacts with this is abstracted away inside of [`src/main/java/com/dillos/dillobot/services/JDAService.java`](`../../src/main/java/com/dillos/dillobot/services/JDAService.java`), but that can be bypassed if you want to do something more _custom_ with DilloBot.
